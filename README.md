Our project aligns with current trends in NAS by incorporating some of the most powerful and widely-adopted methods in this research area. Here is an overview of these approaches:
# Evolutionary Algorithms
* Overview: Evolutionary algorithms mimic the process of natural evolution, using techniques like mutation, crossover, and selection to evolve neural network architectures over generations.

> In our exploration of Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) for Neural Architecture Search (NAS), a pivotal aspect is the multi-objective optimization. This approach is essential for balancing various competing factors in neural network design, such as accuracy, computational complexity, memory usage, and energy efficiency.

>> *Balancing Competing Factors:* The core challenge in NAS is not solely maximizing accuracy, but rather finding an architecture that offers an optimal balance between performance and resource constraints. EAs are uniquely equipped to handle this challenge due to their ability to evolve a diverse set of solutions concurrently.
>
>> *Pareto Front Exploration:* Our focus is on identifying the Pareto front of solutions, where each solution is not dominated by any other in all objectives. This method ensures that the architectures we discover are not just good in one aspect (like accuracy) but are also efficient in terms of computational resources and other factors.
